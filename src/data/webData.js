Your Plan is based on how we treat our own homes. Weâ€™ve found the best bang for the buck is more like this: 1- Late Feb-March: Control early emergence and hit pests when they are at their weakest after winter. 2- May: Control later emerging pests/ants/spiderlings/forming nests. 3- July:  peak summer- to when spiders, flies, wasps, and mosquitos are at their highest levels. 4- September to eliminate them before they find their winter hiding places in your home.",
