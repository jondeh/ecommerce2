            <p>SPOILER ALERT - we don't recommend spraying every 3 months like Pest Control companies offer.

            Pest Control companies lie to you.  Professional grade chemicals only last 6-8 weeks, not 3 months.  That is why we recommend you protect your home every 8 weeks from March-September, and let Mother Nature do the hard work in Winter.

            Custom really means custom.

            Your plan is based on how we treat our own homes.  We've found the best bang for the buck is more like this:
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default HowToSection;
